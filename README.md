## Version Control 

In summary, the script collects user information, calculates the birth year, and outputs a personalized welcome message.
Prompts the user to enter their name and stores it in the variable name.
Asks the user to input their age, converts it to an integer, and stores it in the variable age.

Previously the program only worked to calculate the user's birth year (yob) by subtracting their age from the current year(2023).

The program has now been updated to work with any year 2023 and beyond taking in the user's birthday and calculating how long it is until their next birthday.
Finally, a personalized message is displayed.
Prints a personalized welcome message using an f-string, including the calculated birth year.
